# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 21, 2024

Realistically, I don't see myself coding 1+ hours every single day without breaking the streak or burning out. Therefore, I'll be counting studying CS-related topics as "coding." For example, right now I'm starting something I've been eyeing for a bit: The Odin Project (TOD). If I spend 1+ hours studying from the curriculum, I will be counting it as "coding time," though I know that's not ideal. I feel like if I didn't, I'd overwhelm myself into inaction :v totally not speaking from experience or anything ...

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the setup part of TOD. The biggest things  were having to install a VM with Xubuntu and review some git commands I didn't remember.

**Thoughts:** Twas a little boring. Especially since I already knew a lot of it but couldn't skip it because I could've missed out on something important. But hopefully I'll be actually coding soon :>

### Day 2: December 22, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finally started doing more technical/hands-on learning. Learned about basic HTML tags and made a crappy lil website to mess around in.

**Thoughts:** Pacing feels a little slow given that TOD is made with total newcomers in mind. I might do more lessons per day to to pick up the pace a little.
