# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 21, 2024

Realistically, I don't see myself coding 1+ hours every single day without breaking the streak or burning out. Therefore, I'll be counting studying CS-related topics as "coding." For example, right now I'm starting something I've been eyeing for a bit: The Odin Project (TOD). If I spend 1+ hours studying from the curriculum, I will be counting it as "coding time," though I know that's not ideal. I feel like if I didn't, I'd overwhelm myself into inaction :v totally not speaking from experience or anything ...

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the setup part of TOD. The biggest things  were having to install a VM with Xubuntu and review some git commands I didn't remember.

**Thoughts:** Twas a little boring. Especially since I already knew a lot of it but couldn't skip it because I could've missed out on something important. But hopefully I'll be actually coding soon :>

#

### Day 2: December 22, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finally started doing more technical/hands-on learning. Learned about basic HTML tags and made a crappy lil website to mess around in.

**Thoughts:** Pacing feels a little slow given that TOD is made with total newcomers in mind. I might do more lessons per day to to pick up the pace a little.

#

### Day 3: December 23, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Learned about linking to other sites. Admittedly didn't do much today cuz of Christmas approaching.

**Thoughts:** Fixing my sleeping schedule would help with productivity...

#

### Day 15: January 9, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Started on Javascript! Not much is new to me, mostly learning syntax and the such.

**Thoughts:** n/a

### Day 4: December 24, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Did the first project of the course: making a crummy little recipes website using only HTML.

**Thoughts:** Didn't spend too much time on the project, the reason for this being that I'd be spending time (on Christmas eve no less) working on a very shoddy looking website using concepts I grasp pretty well at this point.
On a more positive note, it did get me excited to learn more :^)  
On top of the work I actually did, I'll also start linking the lessons/modules I worked on in the "Link to work" section.  
From what I can see, we'll probably be revisiting the recipes website in the future and making it look nicer. If I didn't mess anything up, the link to the website repo in the "Link to work" section should show the repo in the state it was in when I finished today.  
Note to self: Work on writing better commit messages. We always wrote commit messages through VSCode in uni, but I'd like to use the terminal from now on. I forgot how to do it ...

### ~~Day 5:~~ December 25, 2024

No work today! Merry Christmas :)

#

### Day 5: December 26, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started the CSS section of TOD. Did 5 practice problems provided by the course.

**Thoughts:** They tackled a lot of topics in one single lesson, which confused me because it hadn't felt that way so far. Need to research the things discussed a little further, 
especially [chaining selectors](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-intro-to-css#chaining-selectors) and [combinators](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-intro-to-css#descendant-combinator).

#

### Day 6: December 27, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot of code to show, I just studied the concepts from yesterday a bit more. 
Finished reading the cascade section in TOP but didn't get a chance to do the excercises. Tomorrow I will :)

**Thoughts:** I might've not done much coding but I was out most of the day and was also fixing up my resume so... future me don't be disappointed I swear I was productive lol

#

### Day 7: December 28, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Mostly theory stuff. Lots of YouTube videos and not enough code to put in the link to work section.

**Thoughts:** none

#

### Day 8: December 29, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Finished some TOD excercises and tinkered with the old recipes website I made earlier in the course.

**Thoughts:** I think I need to slow down and stop going through TOD lessons until I have the previous lessons down well.
I don't feel like I know the material from a couple lessons ago well enough to proceed.
Going forward with these gaps in my knowledge would be shooting myself in the foot... at least, I think so.

#

### Day 9: December 30, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Learned a bit about flexbox. Watched a couple YouTube videos and read about previous concepts.

**Thoughts:** Might not do much tomorrow because of new year's but we'll see!

#

### Day 10: January 3, 2025

**Today's Progress**: A couple of flex excercises and reading.

**Today's Progress**: Tried the TOD Flexbox excercises but struggled. Spent some time looking through alternate sources.
Did all the levels in a little Flexbox game called [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow I'll try and follow a crash course on Flexbox on YouTube or something to fill in the gaps of knowledge I have currently.

**Link to work:** n/a

#

### Day 12: January 5, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Did more TOD Flexbox excercises. I'm finally getting a bit of a better understanding.
The excercises involved making a bunch of different web pages and elements. Started but didn't finish the last excercise.

**Thoughts**: Glad I'm understanding a bit better cuz I was getting a bit frustrated lol. Still need more practice but it's progress!  
Might not do much tomorrow because it's a holiday :v

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Flexbox TOD excercises finallyyy. Also started the project for the flexbox category.
Making ok progress on it! Did the header and the hero section. Missing an info section, a quote section, and the footer.

**Thoughts**: I'll probably run into formatting issues eventually (especially with the footer arghhh) but let's worry about that when it matters.

### Day 21: January 30, 2025

**Today's Progress**: That last entry was lowkey a lie... I hadn't finished the assignments at the end of the lesson... Oops!

**Thoughts:** Got incredibly demotivated as class started :v which resulted in a 2 week + long break. I hope to get back into the groove.
